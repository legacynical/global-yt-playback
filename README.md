<br>An AutoHotkey script to rewind/fast-forward youtube videos while focused on a different window.
<br>
<br>*It's not that the few extra seconds I save from not having to move my mouse and click back and forth will increase my productivity, it's the satifaction of not having to deal with 
that and preventing occassional misfocused window mishaps that will get me to want to use 
it more and work longer.*
<br>
<br>Install AutoHotkey @ https://www.autohotkey.com/
<br>global-yt-playback-v1.0 (should work in windows)
